% INPUTS:
% 1st input must be the filename of the .pdf as a string
%
% Options to include as strings after filename include:
%
% 'verbose' :: will print information on signal parsing/results/signal clipping when the function runs.  
%        Default: If this string is not specified the function returns no text information.
% 
% 'pdfleads' :: Extract all leads directly from the .pdf file
% 
% 'calcleads' :: Extract leads I, II, and V1-V6 from the .pdf file, but calculate leads III, aVR, aVL, and aVF 
%       from the extracted values of leads I and II. 
%
% If 'pdfleads', 'calcleads', is not specified, the default is to use 'calcleads' 
%
% 'adu' :: Data is output in ADU values and not physical units of mV
%
% 'exportfile' :: will export the data from the .pdf into a .csv with the filename 'basename_digitized.csv'
%       if output is in mV or 'basename_digitized_adu.csv' if output is in ADU units. 
%       Default: If this string is not specified the file is not exported to .csv
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
% signals :: a structure containing the lead data in mV (signals.I, signals.V1, etc), the total number of clipped 
%       points in the full ECG (signals.totalClipping), sampling frequency (hz), any rhythm strips if not in a 12 
%       rhythm strip format (rhythm), and if any rhythm strips have clipping (totalClippingRhythm)
%
%       signals.rhythm contains any rhythm strips included with a 4x2.5s or 2x5s format (signals.rhythm.II,
%               signals.rhythm.V1, etc)
%
% info :: a structure containing additional information on how lead were extracted/calculated (leadsMode), ECG layout 
%       format (ecgFormat), leadOrder (lead order in .pdf), lead names of any rhythm strips (rhythmStripLeads), 
%       number of polylines extracted (nPolylines), conversion between units and mV (unitsPerMv), conversion between 
%       units and time (unitsPerSec), number of streams extracted (nStreams), and a structure with additional 
%       information on clipping (clipping)
%
%       info.clipping contains the number of clipped samples in each lead (info.clipped.I, info.clipped_V1, etc) 
%               and the samples that were clipped (info.clipped_I_clipsamples,info.clipped_V1_clipsamples, etc),
%               and the total number of clipped points in the full ECG (info.totalClipping)
%
% *NOTE*: this function as currently only been tested and verified using GE MUSE format .pdf files with sweep 
% speeds are 25 mm/sec.  Variable voltage gains (5 mm/mV, 10 mm/mV, and 20 mm/mV) have been tested/validated.  
% 12 rhythm strips, 3x4 2.5 sec with 0-3 rhythm strups, and 6x2 5 sec with 0-3 rhythm strips are supported,
% but only the 12 rhythm strip format will allow all beats to temporally align in time.  This temporal alignment 
% is CRITICAL for accurate median beat generation.  
%
% This function also assumes data is compressed using FlateDecode and it uses java.util.zip.Inflater.
